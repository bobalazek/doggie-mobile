FAQ
----------------
### No tests and / or automated workflow (besides basic ionic tasks)? 
Yes, I know, I know. I was too much concentrated with rapid development, so I just skipped it. I will do them ASAP. I promise!

### What's that language?
It's Slovenian, but don't worry, it can be translated in any language you want. I've primary translated only Slovenian, because that was also the target audience. Locales can be found in [www/locales/](https://github.com/bobalazek/doggie-mobile/tree/master/www/locales).
